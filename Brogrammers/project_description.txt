CoVid19 Locator

Description:

We have developed an android application which will take the user's location and will also show the quarantined/suspected people around him as well as mass gatherings, for this we will be using the Bluetooth or device location technology to track and trace if the person has come in contact or went near around with anyone having the symptoms. This can be useful in future outbreaks and avoiding a situation of community outbreak as people can be quarantined if necessary. There will be a Dashboard to show the current cases according to the states and the total cases in the country. The app will also show the hospitals which are dedicated for covid-19 treatment as per their location.
The health officials can view the data of the individual users and determine their health according to the questioner provided to them and mark them as suspected, quarantine or healthy. There will be an alert/alarm notification sent to the health workers along with the traced location If there is any mass gathering so the authorized department can take action.
